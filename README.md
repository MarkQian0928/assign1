== CMPT 276 - Assignment 1 

CREATIVITY:

	Percentage Part:

		1. In this assignment, I use "setInterval" to run my "percentage()" function automatically. Once grades are input, the percentage will automatically appear.

		2. If the input number for your personal grade is negative, an "alert" will appear and the wrong input will be cleared. 

			For example: Once you entered A / B, if A is negative, A will be cleard.

			(there is a limitation here, it will work only after you entered both A and B) 

		3. "total grade" for one activity (B) are required to be larger than 0. Otherwise, an "alert" will appear and the "total grade"(B) will be cleared automatically.

		4. the "Grade" inputs are allowed to be changed anytime and the percentage will also be fixed automatically.

		5. If you change one grade input you have entered to a negative number, then alert will appear, the wrong input will be cleared and the "percentage that you get will also be cleared.

		6. I also use ".toFixed()" to limit the percentage number with only integer par

		7. Only numbers are allowed to be input.


	Average Part:

		1. After click the average buttom, the function will first check if the percentage is wrong. If the percentage is larger than 100%, an "alert" will apear and ask you to re-enter the right grade. The wrong grade inputs will be cleared and the "average" function will stop.

		2. In this function, I limit the output number with one decimal number.

		3.If the total average is below 60, an "confirm" alert will appear and ask you if you would like to retake this class next semester. If you click "yes", a new window will open and "go.sfu.ca" webpage will appear. (Computer need to be linked to the Internet)

	Mean Part:

		1. After click the mean buttom, the function will also first check if the percentage is larger than 100%. Same thing will happen as in the average part.
